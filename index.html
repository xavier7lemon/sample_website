    <h1>The TasteMaker Story</h1>

      <p>
        It is just daybreak of 2019, and the idea of a tastemaker is firmly implanted in our vernacular.<br> But just in case you aren’t aware of it, here it is:<br><br>

        <em>noun</em><strong> taste·mak·er \-ˌmā-kər\:</strong> <span class="highlight">a person whose judgments about what is good, fashionable, etc., are accepted and followed by many other people</span><br><br>

        Now, this label is nothing new. It’s been around for ages — arguably forever. The Catholic Church introduced us to the allure of gold in a wardrobe. Martha Stewart taught us what a home should be. Sean John gave us affordable style in a nutshell. Frank Sinatra used envy to portray the modern man. <a href="https://medium.com/milkshake-studio/should-everyone-be-a-tastemaker-5fa7750c8676">Be like me, and your dreams will manifest.</a>

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
